# Hi, I'm Kiran! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I have always had a knack for technology and working with computers. In 2019 I started working with HTML & CSS to make some minor edits on a small project website that I was operating. What I thought was just a few small edits turned into a love for programming.

I started learning JavaScript and was even more enthused with making websites interactive. Now, I am a Full Stack Web Developer and now spending my time building projects with React.Js, Node.Js, Next.Js, MongoDB and learning new technologies.
